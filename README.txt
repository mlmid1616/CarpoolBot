Info:
-The first time the user runs this bot, it should ask them for authorization (a window will open with the first GSuite Scope), but as soon as they give it, it should not prompt them again

To-do:
-Also gather emails of the carpoolers and automatically email them a shareable link to the spreadsheet
-Some additional input validation?
-Something better than the message box after the initial template is opened?
-I am unsure of the proper way to store / utilize the OAuth Client Secret
-Right now the automation uses a test OAuth Client. A more formal one should probably be made for the end product.
